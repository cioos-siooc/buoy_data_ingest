# Reformat OPP CSV data to SWOB format

This script reformats CSV files supplied by ECCC, by renaming to columns to match the Marine [SWOB](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/cmos/public_doc/msc-data/obs_station/SWOB-ML_Product_User_Guide_v8.3_e.pdf) format.

It also converts the wind speeds from m/s to km/h to match SWOB.
